Due to the proprietary nature of this project, the details of this work is limited to publicly released information.

I designed and prototyped a custom, small-scale RC paramotor to serve as a versatile data collection platform for parafoil system identification. I utilized CAD modelling to back integrate the new, custom chassis onto a COTS hobbyist RC paramotor, expanding the COTS paramotor's abilities to better accommodate research needs. This platform enables controlled launches from the ground or aerial deployment, allowing pilots on the ground to steer and conduct repeated trials to better characterize parafoil deployment and inflation dynamics.

## Accomplishments

- Modified a COTS hobbyist RC paramotor to accommodate custom payloads, expanding its suitability for controlled data collection in parafoil testing

- Developed a CAD model for a custom, lightweight electronics, sensor, and control enclosure

- Conducted multiple flight trials, collecting data to support system identification and control algorithm development for parafoil dynamics
