## Design Challenge

Developed a dual-function sealing system that simultaneously:
- Maintains IP67 waterproofing to protect sensitive electronics
- Enables gas permeability for accurate barometric pressure readings during deployment
- Functions reliably in both freshwater and saltwater environments

---

## Key Accomplishments

- Designed a custom O-ring seal to maintain IP67 compliance, ensuring the device remained waterproof and dustproof when the parachute is being actively deployed, stored, or transported.

- Selected and integrated the proper material for a breathable vent system that permitted gas exchange without compromising the device's water resistance to allow for accurate altitude measurements.

- Conducted rigorous testing in both fresh and saltwater to validate the device's performance to ensure reliability and durability in diverse conditions
