Due to the proprietary nature of this project, the details of this work is limited to publicly released information.

I designed and tested the O-ring and breathable vent for Dropmate 2, the parachute event logger, ensuring that the outer shell of the device met IP67 water egress standards in both fresh and saltwater environments. This involved developing a hermetic seal to protect sensitive electronics while allowing for gas permeability, which is crucial for accurate barometric pressure readings during jumps.

## Accomplishments

- Designed a custom O-ring seal to maintain IP67 compliance, ensuring the device remained waterproof and dustproof when the parachute is being actively deployed, stored, or transported.

- Selected and integrated the proper material for a breathable vent system that permitted gas exchange without compromising the device's water resistance to allow for accurate altitude measurements.

- Conducted rigorous testing in both fresh and saltwater to validate the device's performance to ensure reliability and durability in diverse conditions
