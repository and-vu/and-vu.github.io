I participated in the full build of a competition-grade, man-powered "buggy" for Carnegie Mellon University's annual spring carnival. As the driver, the buggy was fit to my proportions. We built the buggy using a combination of carbon fiber and epoxy, followed by the addition of wheels, a custom steering and braking system, and push bar. The result was a lightweight, structurally sound vehicle optimized for speed, handling, and reliability when raced.

## Accomplishments

- Designed a custom, interior mold based on driver dimensions, enabling an optimized fit and streamlined aerodynamics

- Fabricated major structural components by laying carbon fiber and epoxy, curing and trimming composite shells to achieve targeted strength-to-weight ratio

- Assembled and integrated mechanical systems, including wheels, bearings, steering, braking, and drivetrain mounting, to ensure proper alignment and fitment for race conditions.
