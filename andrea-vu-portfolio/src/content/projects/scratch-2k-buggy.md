## Build Process

- Constructed vehicle frame using carbon fiber and epoxy composite layup techniques
- Integrated mechanical systems including wheels, bearings, custom steering and braking systems, and push bar assembly
- Achieved lightweight, structurally sound design optimized for speed, handling, and race reliability

## Key Accomplishments

- Designed a custom, interior mold based on driver dimensions, enabling an optimized fit and streamlined aerodynamics

- Fabricated major structural components by laying carbon fiber and epoxy, curing and trimming composite shells to achieve targeted strength-to-weight ratio

- Assembled and integrated mechanical systems, including wheels, bearings, steering, braking, and drivetrain mounting, to ensure proper alignment and fitment for race conditions.
