## Technical Approach

- Implemented nonlinear vehicle dynamics model with simplified Pacejka tire model for realistic high-speed simulation
- Integrated Model Predictive Controller (MPC) to optimize vehicle stability, speed, and cross-track performance on Silverstone Grand Prix circuit
- Extended framework to identify drift equilibrium points and enable transitions between grip and drift modes through linearized Jacobian models

## Key Accomplishments

- Designed and validated a nonlinear dynamic bicycle model incorporating Pacejka tire dynamics for realistic high-speed vehicle simulation

- Implemented an MPC framework that minimized cross-track and heading error while optimizing velocity and steering smoothness on a diverse race track

- Derived and linearized drift equilibrium models to enable predictive control of steady-state drifting and mode transitions between grip and drift
