I developed a dynamically accurate simulation platform for an F1-10th scale racecar to study high-performance control strategies such as line-following and autonomous drifting. By implementing a nonlinear vehicle dynamics model with a simplified Pacejka tire model and integrating a Model Predictive Controller (MPC), I optimized the F1-10th vehicle for stability, speed, and cross-track performance around the Silverstone Grand Prix circuit. I extended the framework to identify drift equilibrium points and transition between grip and drift modes through linearized Jacobian Models.

## Accomplishments

- Designed and validated a nonlinear dynamic bicycle model incorporating Pacejka tire dynamics for realistic high-speed vehicle simulation

- Implemented an MPC framework that minimized cross-track and heading error while optimizing velocity and steering smoothness on a diverse race track

- Derived and linearized drift equilibrium models to enable predictive control of steady-state drifting and mode transitions between grip and drift
