In collaboration with Dr. Jeffrey Ward, conducted experimental and computational studies on bleed-air actuation for single-surface parafoils to expand control authority for precision airdrop applications.

## Key Accomplishments

- **Investigated aerodynamic effects** of strategically placed upper-surface vents on parafoil performance

- **Designed and modified parafoils** based on computational model results simulating bleed-air spoiler effects on vent shapes and configurations

- **Conducted flight tests** to assess the impact of vent placement on turn rate and glide slope control, providing empirical data to validate computational predictions

- **Identified optimal vent locations** at 10% chord position, achieving up to **40 degree/second turn rates** and **58% glide slope changes**
