In collaboration with Dr. Jeffrey Ward, I conducted experimental and computational studies on bleed-air actuation for single-surface parafoils, aiming to expand the control authority for precision airdrop applications. This research investigates the aerodynamic effects of strategically placed upper-surface vents on parafoil performance. Findings indicate that vent placement significantly influences turn rate and glide slope control, with optimal locations achieving up to 40 degree/second turn rates and 58% glide slope changes.

## Accomplishments

- Designed vent shapes for bleeding air, then altered small-scale parafoils based off results from computational model that simulated the effects of bleed-air spoilers on parafoil aerodynamics

- Conducted flight tests to assess the impact of vent placement on turn rate and glide slope control, providing empirical data to validate computational predictions

- Identified optimal vent locations at 10% chord position for maximizing control authority
