**Disclaimer:** This is a work in progress.

I am currently working to expand the locomotion versatility of snake robots by enabling them to explore non-simple, 3D environments through the development of a new gait. The gait allows segments of the robot's body to alternate between anchoring for stability or articulate for motion, enabling the robot to perform a hybrid mobility-manipulation behavior. The project emphasizes kinematic modelling, constraint-based optimization, and motion planning for complex environments.
