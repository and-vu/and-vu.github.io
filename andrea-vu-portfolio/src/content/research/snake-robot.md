**Disclaimer:** This is a work in progress.

Developing a new gait to expand the locomotion versatility of snake robots for exploring non-simple, 3D environments through hybrid mobility-manipulation behavior.

---

## Current Focus

- **Designing novel gait** that allows body segments to alternate between anchoring for stability and articulating for motion

- **Developing kinematic modeling** and constraint-based optimization for complex environment navigation

- **Implementing motion planning algorithms** for 3D environment exploration and obstacle traversal
