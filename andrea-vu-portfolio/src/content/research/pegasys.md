**Disclaimer:** Due to the proprietary nature of this project, the details of this work is limited to publicly released information.

Developed the proof-of-concept, development, and testing of the Precision and Extended Glide Airdrop System, a high-performance powered paraglider system designed for cargo delivery in contested environments. Project conducted in collaboration with the US Army's DEVCOM Soldier Center and Aerial Delivery Solutions.

## Accomplishments

- Enhanced precision and range of airdrop operations, enabling accurate payload delivery over extended distances while reducing risk to aircrews

- Led and executed multiple flight tests to validate system performance across multiple test beds

- Analyzed flight data to assess paraglider performance viability and consistency, informing design improvements

- Refined deployment strategies and assessed payload capacity under various deployment conditions
