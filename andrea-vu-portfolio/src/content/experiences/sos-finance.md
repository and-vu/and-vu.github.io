As VP of Finance, I managed the budgeting, fundraising, and resource allocation that supported Students Organizing for Sustainability's (SOS) mission of promoting sustainable practices and urban gardening on campus via the community garden and other green initiatives. During my term, I oversaw the major 10x expansion of the community garden on Georgia Tech's campus and secured funding to equip it with the necessary supplies to support the expansion and increase the impact across the campus community.

## Accomplishments

- Led fundraising efforts and submitted donation/grant applications that provided the financial means for SOS's garden expansion and urban, gardening projects

- Directed financial planning for the community garden's expansion (including seeds, tools, soil, and garden beds), supporting the increase of garden size by 10x

- Developed and implemented a budget tracking system and reporting framework for the organization to improve transparency and financial stewardship when reporting to the Student Organization Finance Office (SOFO)
