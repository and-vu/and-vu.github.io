As a student representative on the Woodruff School Student Advisory Committee (WSSAC), I served as a direct voice for my peers, collaborating with faculty and administration to shape policies and initiatives that enhance the student experience in the Mechanical Engineering School. I worked to translate student perspectives into actionable feedback and contributed to discussions on curricular, co-curricular, and resource-allocation matters.
