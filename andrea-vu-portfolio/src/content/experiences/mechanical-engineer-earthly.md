## Research & Development

- Conducted experimental research on paraglider aerial deployment dynamics, investigating causes of asymmetric inflation and collapse to inform reliable high-performance wing deployment strategies

- Developed and validated novel aerial deployment system through iterative prototyping and flight testing in collaboration with U.S. Army CCDC Soldier Center and industry partners

- Integrated mechanical design with empirical testing and data analysis to advance understanding of paraglider inflation behavior, supporting PEGASYS transition from proof-of-concept to functional research prototype

---

## Product Development

- Designed and tested Dropmate v2.0, an IP67-rated parachute event logger, including mechanical housing design (O-ring sealing, breathable vent integration) and environmental validation in saltwater and humidity conditions

- Modified and evaluated small-scale paragliders (ram-air and single-surface) to assess aerodynamics and venting strategies, generating scalable design insights for full-sized platforms

## Lab Operations & Infrastructure

- Maintained 3D printing systems (Prusa MK4s), fabricated prototypes, and troubleshot hardware for rapid test iteration

- Supported research team through technical documentation, experimental setup, and data collection processes
