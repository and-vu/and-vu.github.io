- Conducted experimental research on paraglider aerial deployment dynamics, investigating causes of asymmetric inflation and collapse to inform reliable high-performance wing deployment strategies.

- Developed and validated a novel aerial deployment system through iterative prototyping and flight testing in collaboration with the U.S. Army CCDC Soldier Center and industry partners.

- Integrated mechanical design with empirical testing and data analysis to advance understanding of paraglider inflation behavior and support the transition of PEGASYS from proof-of-concept to functional research prototype.

- Designed and tested Dropmate v2.0, an IP67-rated parachute event logger, including mechanical housing design (O-ring sealing, breathable vent integration) and environmental validation in saltwater and humidity.

- Modified and evaluated small-scale paragliders (ram-air and single-surface) to assess aerodynamics and venting strategies, supporting scalable design insights for full-sized platforms.

- Supported lab infrastructure by maintaining 3D printing systems (Prusa MK4s), fabricating prototypes, and troubleshooting hardware for rapid test iteration
