As a Prototyping Instructor, I served as a hands-on mentor in one of the country's largest, student-run makerspace, guiding peers in operating advanced fabrication tools and overseeing safe project development. I helped to turn concepts into functional prototypes by helping students select proper fabrication methods, understand tool capabilities, and safely bring their visions to life.

## Accomplishments

- Mentored 100+ students through hands-on tool-use and prototype phases, allowing their projects to transform from a concept into a tangible result

- Trained student for safe, effective operation of 3D printers, laser cutters, CNC mills, metal-working tools, waterjet, wood-working tools, electronics tools, sewing machines, and routers.

- Troubleshooted mechanical and fabrication issues for various tools in the makerspace
