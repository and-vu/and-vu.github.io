As the Social Media Coordinator for the Campus Kitchen Project, I managed the organization's digital presence to promote food insecurity in college students, food sustainability, and waste-reduction initiatives across campus. I established the team's online identity and outreach strategy, helping connect more volunteers, donors, and campus organizations to our mission of fighting food insecurity.

## Accomplishments

- Created and launched the organization's email, Instagram page, and Linktree, establishing a cohesive digital presence that increased volunteer engagement and overall visibility in the greater Atlanta community

- Expanded outreach to Greek life in addition to campus dining halls, leading to new partnerships with other campus organizations that contributed to higher food recovery rates and more consistent donation streams

- Coordinated meal donations with the on-campus food pantry, STAR, and off-campus community fridges, churches, and homeless shelters
