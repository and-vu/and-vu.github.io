In addition to my role as a Prototyping Instructor, I supported the metal shop's CNC operations by programming, setting up, and maintaining milling equipment to assist students in translating their designs into precision-machined parts. In conjunction with the other Metal CNC apprentices and the Metal CNC Master, we upheld rigorous safety and quality standards while fostering hands-on fabrication learning for a wide variety of academic, research, and personal projects.

## Accomplishments

- Developed CAM in Fusion 360 for several prototype components, ensuring safe, successful, and accurate machining

- Programmed and operated CNC mills for student projects, including creating soft jaws for work-holding, choosing appropriate surface finishes, and proper tooling choices

- Performed preventative maintenance and diagnosed issues on CNC equipment, identifying tolerancing issues, axis calibration, and tool wear
