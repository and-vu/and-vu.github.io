As an avid racing enthusiast, I served as lead driver and active fabricator on the SAE Buggy Racing Team, building the vehicle that I race in, coordinating early-morning training, and engaging with sponsors and SAE alum. I laid carbon fiber, assembled the vehicle, and fostered team commitment by recruiting and organizing weekend volunteers and practice runners, while representing the team with alumni and sponsors to secure financial support and maintain good relations.

## Accomplishments

- Organized and motivated a crew of runners for early-morning weekend practice sessions, improving coordination between driver, pushers, and crew.

- Engaged with SAE alumni and sponsors to showcase the new buggy, expressed team appreciation, and strengthened sponsorship relationships to support budget and material contributions

- Placed 11th in Women's and 13th in Men's Races for 2025 Carnival (First time racing)
